# Kan

Experimental successor to my [Emergence project](https://github.com/KonstantinTomashevich/Emergence) that uses pure C.

## Name

It is named **Kan** simply because I think I **can** achieve better results with pure C and because my name is 
**K**onstantin. So, that is why this project is **Kan**.

## License

This project is licensed under [AGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html).

### Motivation

The main motivation for using AGPLv3 license is that open source software should remain open source.
Open source projects exist thanks to hard work of their authors and community. It would be unfair to let anyone
who doesn't support open source software ideas to use these software without properly supporting its authors.

### Plans

If this project becomes mature enough to be used in commercial development, it might become dual-licensed with separate
commercial license for those who do not want to comply to AGPLv3.

## Acknowledgements

This project uses several third-party open source libraries, listened in alphabetic order below:

- [cglm](https://github.com/recp/cglm/) -- graphics math library written in plain C.
- [debugbreak](https://github.com/scottt/debugbreak/) -- cross-platform programmatic debug break implementation.
- [qsort](https://github.com/svpv/qsort/) -- quick sort implementation using only macros.
- [re2c](https://github.com/skvadrik/re2c/) -- lexer generator.
- [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/) -- cross-platform direct media layer.
- [SPIRV-Headers](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Headers) -- header files for reading and writing SPIRV binary.
- [tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/) -- real time profiler for game development.
