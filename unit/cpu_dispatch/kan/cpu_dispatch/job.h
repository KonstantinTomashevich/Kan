/// \brief Describes job -- a high-level activity, that can be executed by multiple threads in parallel.
///
/// \par Job
/// \parblock
/// Technically, job is just aa group of tasks, that are executed in parallel and do not depend on each other, but
/// describe some high-level activity as a group. For example, game system or algorithm that migrates lots of objects.
/// In addition, job can automatically dispatch completion tasks once all other tasks are finished and you can also
/// wait for the job, putting calling thread to sleep until all tasks in a job are finished (excluding completion task).
/// \endparblock
///
/// \par Job lifecycle
/// \parblock
/// After job is created, it is in assembly state. It means that it waits for all required tasks to be dispatched in
/// job context using kan_cpu_job_dispatch_task or kan_cpu_job_dispatch_task_list. All tasks, dispatched using these
/// functions, will be registered as dependencies of this job. Keep in mind, that tasks, dispatched that way, are
/// added to the execution queue like any other tasks and might be executed right away. But job cannot be completed in
/// assembly state, therefore it is safe. To report that all tasks are added and job can be completed, you need to
/// release job using kan_cpu_job_release. Only after this point completion task might be dispatched, even if all other
/// tasks were finished during assembly state. After transitioning to release state, you can either wait for the job or
/// detach from it. Either way, once kan_cpu_job_detach or kan_cpu_job_wait exits, job handle is no longer valid.
/// Detaching does not stop the job, it only allows implementation to free its resources on completion. Also, cancelled
/// tasks do not block their job from completing, they'll just be ignored.
/// \endparblock
