/// \brief This file stores various resource types needed to properly store, compile and use render passes.

/// \par Overview
/// \parblock
/// Render pass has the information needed for creation of render backend pass along with pass variants. Pass variant
/// is a combination of specific additional sources and compilation options with KAN_RPL_OPTION_SCOPE_INSTANCE scope,
/// that need to be inserted into material code while compiling this particular pass variant. One pass can have multiple
/// variants as passed might need to draw the same geometry several times with different pipelines, for example to
/// implement outline or some other complex effect. As a result, every pass variant has its unique layout, which is
/// described in compiled variant resource.
///
/// Also, tag requirement system is created for passes in order to avoid compiling anything for passes that are not
/// supported by target platform. It is also useful for excluding development-only passes like editor and debug
/// passes, because we don't need them in final build.
