/// \file
/// \brief Provides API for serializing data from and to binary format using reflection.
///
/// \par Script storage
/// \parblock
/// Binary serialization uses internal script system to make serialization and deserialization faster. Instead of
/// directly using reflection in reader and writer, binary serialization generates internal scripts that are then used
/// by readers and writers. Scripts merge fields into blocks whenever possible, including recursively merging fields
/// from different substructures if possible. It greatly reduces count of IO operations and optimizes serialization
/// speed, but has a side effect of serializing and deserializing padding bytes.
/// \endparblock
///
/// \par Interned string registry
/// \parblock
/// Interned strings usually have common values in lots of different structure. In runtime it is optimized by string
/// interning -- there is always only one instance of common string in memory. But due to unstable nature of string
/// interning, it cannot be used for serialization. Usual solution is to write interned strings as common strings and
/// intern them during deserialization, but it results in lots of duplication in serialized data.
///
/// To combat this duplication we use interned string registry: special registry for interned strings that are used
/// in serialization. If interned string registry is used, interned strings are serialized as 32-bit integers which
/// greatly reduces their impact on serialized data size. Interned string registry is automatically populated during
/// serialization and can be then saved afterwards. To deserialize data, interned string registry must be deserialized
/// first and passed to appropriate readers.
/// \endparblock
///
/// \par Reading
/// \parblock
/// To read specific type from binary stream, use `kan_serialization_binary_reader_t`. It can be created using
/// `kan_serialization_binary_reader_create` function. Reading is step-based: instead of reading everything through one
/// blocking function, user can pause and resume by just stopping calling `kan_serialization_binary_reader_step`
/// function. See information about step return state in comments to `kan_serialization_state_t`. To destroy
/// `kan_serialization_binary_reader_t` after reading use `kan_serialization_binary_reader_destroy` function.
/// \endparblock
///
/// \par Writing
/// \parblock
/// To write specific type to binary stream, use `kan_serialization_binary_writer_t`. It can be created using
/// `kan_serialization_binary_writer_create` function. Writing is step-based: instead of writing everything through one
/// blocking function, user can pause and resume by just stopping calling `kan_serialization_binary_writer_step`
/// function. See information about step return state in comments to `kan_serialization_state_t`. To destroy
/// `kan_serialization_binary_writer_t` after writing use `kan_serialization_binary_writer_destroy` function.
/// \endparblock
///
/// \par Type headers
/// \parblock
/// In some cases data type is unknown, therefore type header in the beginning of the stream is needed to read type
/// name. For reading and writing type headers use `kan_serialization_binary_read_type_header` and
/// `kan_serialization_binary_write_type_header`. Type headers are allowed to use interned string registries like
/// other serialization logic.
