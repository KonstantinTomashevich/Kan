/// \par Definition
/// \parblock
/// Render foundation texture management automatically loads and unloads textures based on `kan_render_texture_usage_t`
/// instances. Render foundation checks all usages and loads only the mip intervals that are advised by at least one
/// usages. When texture is loaded, `kan_render_texture_loaded_t` instance is created with appropriate render image.
/// When there is no more usages, `kan_render_texture_loaded_t` is automatically deleted.
/// In development, hot reload is supported and `kan_render_texture_loaded_t` render image is updated when needed.
