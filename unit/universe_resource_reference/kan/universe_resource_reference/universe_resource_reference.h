/// \brief Provides public API for Resource Reference extension for Universe unit.

/// \par Definition
/// \parblock
/// Resource reference extension is built on top of resource provider extension and provides API for retrieving
/// references to resources. It is able to attach all outer references of particular resource to its native entry,
/// also it supports scan-all-resources-that-can-reference-requested-type query, which is useful when you need to
/// get inner references to particular resource. It also utilizes resource pipeline unit and caching for references.
///
/// Disambiguation. Outer references are references that go from its resource to other resources. For example,
/// material instance may reference texture and it is registered as outer reference. Inner references are references
/// that go from other resources to its resource. For example, when material instances references texture, it is an
/// inner reference to texture.
